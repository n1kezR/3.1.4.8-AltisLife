###Personal Note
*We all should thank Tonic. ItsYuka for his updating and hassling of Tonic and for also now taking over the furthering of the project.  I personally would like to thank the following persons or communities as I have either learned, or used(with permission) something from you or something that was shared publicly or just something you wrote that helped me understand something a lot better.

-many other people for whom you will see their names in the credits of the file that was relevant.
 Many names from armaholic. To be honest, most of the scripts/tutorials on altisliferpg.com are really just modified versions from armaholic. It's not hard to do this, but it is hard to write, invent and come up with your own stuff. So make sure to give credit where credit is due. Take the time to learn and be creative. Always remember to have fun, it is video game...*
